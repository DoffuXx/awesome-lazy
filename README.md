## LazyDocker

LazyDocker is a terminal UI for Docker and Docker Compose, also written in Go by the same developer as Lazygit. It provides a convenient way to manage Docker containers, images, volumes, networks, and more, all from within a single, easy-to-use interface. With LazyDocker, you can monitor your Docker environment, inspect running containers, and perform various Docker-related tasks without the need to switch between multiple command-line tools.
